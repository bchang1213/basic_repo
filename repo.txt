Created a repository named basic_repo and pushed it to
a similarly named repo on Github.

Called git init on the local repo, created a file, added data
and then called:

git add -A

git commit -m "message"

git push -u origin master

to push to the master branch on github.

Then I created a branch called test and made changes,
merged the information on both branches together, and added,
commited, and pushed the information to github again.
